Test cases will be graded as follows:
	2 points for correct output
	1-2 points for mostly correct output
	0-1 points for partially correct output
	0 points for no output / can not run

Test1.txt
A simple test case with a .txt extension to test that your
compiler only accepts .mkd files.

Test2.mkd
A simple test case containing only markdown annotations (i.e., 
no macro tags) to test that the compiler works properly for a
simple case.  

Test3.mkd
A simple test case containing only markdown annotations (i.e., 
no macro tags) in lower case to test that the compiler is not 
case sensitive. 	 

Test4.mkd
A simple test case containing invalid markdown annotations to
test that the lexical analzyer recognizes unknown lexemes and
reports them as lexical errors. 

Test5.mkd
A simple test case containing a single, defined macro tag to 
test that the compiler works properly for a macro in a 
simple case. Taken from example in project handout. 

Test6.mkd
A simple test case containing a single, undefined macro tag to 
test that the compiler detects the use of an uknown macro. Should
report a static semantic error.  

Test7.mkd
A test case to test the scoping of a macro tag. Taken from the
suggested test cases in the project handout. 

Test8.mkd 
A test case to ensure if there are annotations after #DOCUMENT END 
are reported as syntax errors.

Test9.mkd
A test case using multiple macro definition and use tags to 
ensure that the parser can handle multiple macros.

Test10.mkd
A test case with legal annotations not following the grammar to
test that the parser is enforcing the grammar rules. Should
report a syntax error.
